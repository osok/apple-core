# Development Notes

## 2025-05-15: Implementing Fat/Universal Binary Support

Added support for parsing Fat/Universal binaries (task P1.4). These are binaries that contain multiple architecture-specific Mach-O objects. For example, a universal binary might contain both ARM64 and x86_64 versions of the same executable.

### Implemented Features:

1. **Fat Header Detection and Parsing**: Added logic to detect and parse the fat header, which contains a count of architecture slices.
2. **Fat Architecture Structure Parsing**: Implemented parsing of fat arch structures, which describe the location and size of each Mach-O object in the fat binary.
3. **64-bit Fat Binary Support**: Included support for the 64-bit variant of fat binaries (FAT_MAGIC_64).

### Database Changes:

1. **MachoFile Model Update**: Added the `is_fat_binary` field to track whether a file is a fat binary.
2. **Header Model Update**: Added `arch_offset` and `arch_size` fields to track the location and size of each Mach-O object within a fat binary.
3. **Created Migration Script**: Added a database migration script to apply these schema changes.

### Testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: Created unit tests for fat binary detection, fat header parsing, and fat arch structure parsing.
2. **Integration Test**: Added a test that creates a mock fat binary file with x86_64 and ARM64 architectures to verify the entire parsing process.

## 2025-05-16: Completed Fat/Universal Binary Support

Successfully implemented and tested fat/universal binary support:

1. **Test Suite Complete**: All tests for fat binary support are now passing.
2. **Migration Setup**: Created a script to run the database migrations and properly linked the migration to the existing schema.
3. **Task Status**: Updated task P1.4 to "Complete" status.

All the required functionality for Checkpoint C2 related to fat/universal binary support is now implemented and tested. We can now move on to Checkpoint C2 once we verify all the other tasks for this checkpoint are complete.
