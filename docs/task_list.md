## Development Workflow

1. Check the task list before starting new work
2. Only work on tasks whose dependencies are marked as 'Complete'
3. Update task status to 'In Progress' when beginning work
4. Implement tests alongside functionality as indicated by test tasks (T prefix)
5. Run all tests at checkpoints (C prefix) before marking related tasks complete
6. Commit code to repository after successfully passing checkpoint tests
7. Update task status to 'Complete' only after all tests pass
8. Document any blockers or issues in the notes.md file
9. Break large tasks into smaller sub-tasks if they take more than 4 hours

## Checkpoint Process

Before marking a checkpoint as complete:
1. Ensure all tasks required for the checkpoint are complete
2. Run all associated tests and ensure they pass
3. Commit code with message: 'Checkpoint [C#]: [CHECKPOINT DESCRIPTION]'
4. Create a tag in the repository for the checkpoint
5. Update the checkpoint status to 'Complete'
6. Start a new conversation after each checkpoint to keep context fresh
